# Note-Taker-Using-ExpressJS-11

## Description
The motivation to build this Note Taker Application was to keep track of tasks that I needed to complete or for taking notes throughout my day or week. Furthermore, I used this project to develope and practice using new technologies in my journey to develope a full-stack application. For this application I used NodeJS, ExpressJS as my server, and Javascript, HTML, and CSS for the Front-End.

## Installation

There is no installation required. All the user needs to do is head to the website link: https://note-taker-using-expressjs-11-c260e174880f.herokuapp.com/notes to begin using the note taker application. 
## Usage

Using the Note Tacker application is simple. Just head to the website link and click on the Get Started button which will take you to the notes page where you can add notes and save them. The application also allows the user to delete the tasks/notes that they no longer need by clicking on the red trash can next to the note saved note on the left hand side.
